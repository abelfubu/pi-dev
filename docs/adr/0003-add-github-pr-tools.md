# Add GitHub tools to pi-dev

We will add a GitHub tool surface to the `@abelfubu/pi-dev` extension, backed by the GitHub CLI (`gh`). This lets agents manage pull requests, issues, workflow runs, workflows, and releases through typed tools instead of raw `bash`.

## Considered options

- **Keep using `bash` for `gh` commands** — This is what `slice-ship.delegate` and other agents do today. It works, but every agent has to remember the right flags, handle the interactive prompts, and parse the text output. It also leaves GitHub operations implicit in the tool list.
- **Create a separate package** (e.g. `@abelfubu/pi-github`) — Keeps concerns isolated, but adds install, versioning, and maintenance overhead for a surface that is already conceptually part of the pi-dev workflow.
- **Add tools to `@abelfubu/pi-dev`** — Reuses the existing extension package and skill directory. The package already hosts Jira tools and code-check tools; GitHub tools are the natural third leg.

## Decision

Add the tools to `@abelfubu/pi-dev` and expose them as a new skill, `skills/github/SKILL.md`.

## Tool surface

### Pull requests
- `gh_pr_create` — Open a PR with title, body, base branch, head branch, and draft flag. Returns the PR URL.
- `gh_pr_list` — List PRs with filters.
- `gh_pr_view` — Read a PR by number, branch, or URL.
- `gh_pr_checks` — List CI status for a PR.
- `gh_pr_merge` — Merge a PR (merge, squash, rebase) or enable auto-merge.
- `gh_pr_comment` — Comment on a PR.
- `gh_pr_close` — Close a PR.
- `gh_pr_reopen` — Reopen a PR.
- `gh_pr_review` — Submit a review.
- `gh_pr_diff` — Show the PR diff.

### Issues
- `gh_issue_create` — Create an issue.
- `gh_issue_list` — List issues with filters.
- `gh_issue_view` — Read an issue by number.
- `gh_issue_comment` — Comment on an issue.
- `gh_issue_close` — Close an issue with a reason.
- `gh_issue_reopen` — Reopen an issue.

### CI / workflows
- `gh_run_list` — List workflow runs.
- `gh_run_view` — View a run, including failed logs.
- `gh_run_rerun` — Rerun a run.
- `gh_workflow_list` — List workflows.
- `gh_workflow_trigger` — Trigger a workflow dispatch with inputs.

### Releases
- `gh_release_list` — List releases.
- `gh_release_view` — View a release by tag.
- `gh_release_create` — Create a release.

## Consequences

- Requires `gh` to be installed and authenticated. This is already assumed by the `ship-slice` chain, so it does not introduce a new dependency for existing users.
- `gh pr create` prints a URL on success rather than JSON; the tool parses the URL from stdout.
- `gh pr view`, `gh pr checks`, `gh issue`, `gh run`, `gh workflow`, and `gh release` support `--json`, so output parsing is straightforward.
- The `slice-ship.delegate` agent should be updated to prefer `gh_pr_create` once the tools exist, but `bash` remains a fallback.
- The extension name stays `@abelfubu/pi-dev`, but the package description and README should be updated to mention GitHub tools.
